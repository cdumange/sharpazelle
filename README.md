# sharpazelle

## What's that ?

Sharpazelle is supposed to be a Gazelle plugin to allow C# rules generation. It uses dotnet_rules.

## Is it working ?

No it's not. This was a test. The skeleton of the project is valid and generated files but a few hickups have made me stop development.

- No management of implicit usings in dotnet_rules
- Complexity of managing resources
